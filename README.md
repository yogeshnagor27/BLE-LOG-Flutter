## Bluetooth Peripheral Connection App

## Overview
The aim of this project is to create a software application that connects to Bluetooth peripheral devices such as lights and other Bluetooth devices. The project involved developing both backend and frontend components of the application using FLUTTER and DART programming languages. The application was tested on Android Studio development environment that simulated an iOS device.

## Tasks
The major tasks accomplished in this project are:

- Developing a software application that connects to Bluetooth peripheral devices such as Lights and Bluetooth devices.
- Designing and implementing both backend and frontend components of the application.
- Successfully establishing a Bluetooth connection between the backend component and a peripheral device using an iOS simulator.
- Using Android Studio development environment to simulate an iOS device for testing purposes.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this project:

- FLUTTER
- DART
- HTML
- CSS
- BLE Communication
- Android Studio code
- IOS-simulator

## Errors Faced and Solutions
One of the issues faced during the project was when connecting to the simulator via the backend. However, after testing the Bluetooth connection through an iOS simulator, the issue was resolved.

## Conclusion
The software application successfully connects to Bluetooth peripheral devices, and the frontend and backend components work seamlessly. The project was implemented using FLUTTER and DART programming languages, with testing done on Android Studio development environment that simulated an iOS device. The successful Bluetooth connection between the backend component and a peripheral device using an iOS simulator demonstrates the effectiveness of the project in connecting to Bluetooth devices.
